# Regression Models
Unlike Classification models, these models do not have discrete output labels, they instead can output a range of values, not limited to the training dataset

This week, we try to build a model that can predict house prices based on some simple attributes. Since, most of it is similar to the previous session, we will shift our focus to other interesting features/stuff we can do to better understand our data and our models.

For more of a challenge, check out the [Boston House pricing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices) available on the Kaggle website.
