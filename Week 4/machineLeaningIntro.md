# Intro To A.I

In this brief intro session we will be discussing breifly what A.I is. Why it is becoming popular. What are your interests and look at some
intersting ways how A.I can help you. We will also see the major sections of A.I and then move on to code your very own machine leaning Algorithm to
some of the logical gates such as AND and OR.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Let us first discuss what Intelligence is? Humans are, dogs are, pigs are the second smartest animal next to human.
But then again a computer can compute 652323675232*73642983498 effortlessly and yet it will take me atleast 10 minutes to compute it.
Yet computers are not why? The major difference is that humans and most animals learn. They do mistakes and then *optimize* there actions.
Whereas computers at the momment are programmable devices. All this time you did python programming to solve a particular program.
You gave the steps for the computer to follow. That is just being a master student going to uni to get 1.0. No offence Quang and Thomas!

Now comming back to A.I., this basically means making a computer teach to learn from its mistake and complete a task. The experience in ths case 
is termed as data. It requires large amount of data to make a computer smart at a task as you would see in the upcoming fun filled and exhausting
weeks!

## Why A.I now?
This does not really require an answer. With better processors and GPU (Graphical processing units) optimizing a problem which other wise would 
have taken days can take one hour or even few minutes if you are using NVIDI TX 1080.

## What is in A.I?

A.I is not magic or some super natural phenomenon which makes your computer suddenly super smart. To burst everyone bubbles it is Math! Specially
statistics probabilty and differentiation. If you do not know all these. From the word of a legend in the field Dr. Andrew NG--

### Branches of A.I

The three major branches or more like heirarachy how A.I is broken down is as follows-

Machine Learning -----> Deep Learning -----> Reinforcement Learning. Other branches include evolutional algorithms.

# Machine Learning

We will be focussing mainly on machine learning for the first week getting familiar with the various aspects and the three major categories.
You will have example codes to follow along and code yourself. Hope you have fun!
