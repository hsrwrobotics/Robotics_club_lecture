# Intro To A.I

In this brief intro session we will be discussing breifly what A.I is. Why it is becoming popular. What are your interests and look at some
interesting ways how A.I can help you. We will also see the major sections of A.I and then move on to code your very own machine leaning Algorithm to
some of the logical gates such as AND and OR.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Let us first discuss what Intelligence is? Humans are, dogs are, pigs are the second smartest animal next to human.
But then again a computer can compute 652323675232*73642983498 effortlessly and yet it will take me atleast 10 minutes to compute it.
Yet computers are not why? The major difference is that humans and most animals learn. They do mistakes and then *optimize* there actions.
Whereas computers at the momment are programmable devices. All this time you did python programming to solve a particular program.
You gave the steps for the computer to follow. That is just being a master student going to uni to get 1.0. No offence Quang and Thomas!

Now comming back to A.I., this basically means making a computer teach to learn from its mistake and complete a task. The experience in ths case 
is termed as data. It requires large amount of data to make a computer smart at a task as you would see in the upcoming fun filled and exhausting
weeks!

## Why A.I now?
This does not really require an answer. With better processors and GPU (Graphical processing units) optimizing a problem which other wise would 
have taken days can take one hour or even few minutes if you are using NVIDI TX 1080.

## What is in A.I?

A.I is not magic or some super natural phenomenon which makes your computer suddenly super smart. To burst everyone bubbles it is Math! Specially
statistics probabilty and differentiation. If you do not know all these. From the word of a legend in the field Dr. Andrew NG--

### Branches of A.I

The three major branches or more like heirarachy how A.I is broken down is as follows-

Machine Learning -----> Deep Learning -----> Reinforcement Learning. Other branches include evolutional algorithms.

# Machine Learning

We will be focussing mainly on machine learning for the first week getting familiar with the various aspects and the three major categories. 
The three main thing that is involved in any machinelearning algorithm are--->
1. Train 2. Test and 3. Validate.
Trianing is the main training of the model that you are trying to develop this is the key step. You model prediction depend a lot on 
how you train more details will follow.
Validate- Validation set is required to validate how your model performs in unseen data and tries to optimize the model further.
Test-This is for you to make a sanity check. 

You will have example codes to follow along and code yourself. Hope you have fun!
## Types of Machine Learning
There are three main categories of Machine Learning-
### Supervised
In this class of machine learning the thing that you are trying to predict has the pre defined label. From there you have to seperte the data sets into X features and Y the label you are trying to predict. In supervised learing the algorithms tr to learn from already 
existing data.

### Un-supervised
Sometimes the data that you recieve might not have any labels attach to eat. This is usually the case of messy data and you ned to make some sense from it. This is where unsupervised learning comes in. That is using these set of algorithms you can have clusters and pattens in data which can be used to group these into specific categories or labels.

### Semi-Supervised 
This is a class of hybrid algorithms. Once the pattern or clusters of the data is made using unsupervised learning you can apply supervised techniquues to make predictions. This is really powerful specially in case of object recognition using 3-D camera.

### Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a special calss of machine learning. Unlike machine learning where you deal with a single perceptron (details will follow soon) you deal with multiple such perceptrons with number of different layers.

### Reinforcemnet Learning
These are the class of algorithm which helps the computer learn on its own. Famous examples include the computer which beat the top player in the game of GO. The most recent one is the computer simulation which taught itself to play hide and seek and come up with insane but logical strategies.
