## Introduction to Classes
Classes and objects are the fundamentals of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). Classes, like functions, enable code re-usability, and more. 

### Drawing Parallels
**In programming**
- Classes are user defined datatypes, in that the user defines what makes up a class and how they behave and interact with each other, similar to how each datatype behaves and interacts in a "pre-defined" way.
- Classes are advanced (complex) functions, they have a definition block and need to be 'called' to use them. Each 'call' of a class creates an 'instance' of that class, referred to as an object.

**In real world**
- A car has 4 wheels and some name and make. Porsch 911 is a car that has 4 wheels with the name 911 and the make Porsche. Then, a car is a class and the Porsche 911 is an object of that class.

## Error Handling
Errors can be broadly classified into 2 types - Syntax and Execution.

It's always good practice to execute code within `try:` `except:` blocks to catch any errors. The `except:` block is also useful for displaying the type of error detected.
