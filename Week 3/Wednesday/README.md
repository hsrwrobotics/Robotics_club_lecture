# A primitive text-based RPG
**This session delves into class inheritance and using libraries. A wholesome example that covers the range of basics in Python programming covered over the previous weeks: A simple text RPG game that lets the user perform a limited set of actions **

## The Concept
### Classes
A game object has a name, class/category name, a description and an object database --> super class

A character is a game object that has a certain class name and description and additionally health points. --> derived class

### Functions
Actions are specific tasks that a player is allowed to carr out. Some may or may not affect a game object

### Libraries
The above two are used as libraries for the execution of the game. All executable lines are specified inside try except blocks to detect errors.


## Scripts
The scripts provided here have additional functionality than what was covered during the session. And serve only as reference. 
Simply run the `text_rpg_game.py` file from the command line (or Anaconda prompt).
```
python text_rpg_game.py
```
