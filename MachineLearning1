# What is Artificial Intelligence?

Before we answer this let us think about what is intellgence?. Humans are intellgent, a dog is intelligent, pig is supposed to be the second smartest animal after
humans. But what makes us intellgent and a computer which can perform fast super human calculations not intelligent? I cannot calculate 64832*63213
but a computer can but still it is not intelligent hmmmm why? This is because we keep learning we do mistakes we learn and we become better.
This is intellgence. Now the question is can a computer do the same? Yes, they can and this is called Artificial Intelligence and all that
this experiences basically is *data*. To make an A.I agent smart you need to deal with a lot of data. Which you will see as we go on.
