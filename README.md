## Week 1:
- In this week, we start the first lecture in Python programming. Python is a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It is one of the most three common programming languages in the worlds and is used by Google, Yahoo, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, etc.
- We will use *Anaconda*, a free and open-source distribution of the Python. Depending on your operating system, you need to find the compatible Anaconda packages in [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
- We recommend using the Spyder IDE for scripting your python codes, since it comes preinstalled with a ton of useful features.
- An awesome book for Python which we recommend is "Automated the Boring Stuff with Python". You can refer to the online version [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) or download the pdf file [here](http://bit.ly/2W6zTtN).
- For people who prefer learning with video, we recommend the 6 hours Python Tutorial for Beginners by Mosh [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc).
- **Agenda**: 
    - Installing Anaconda Python
    - Datatypes: variables, input, strings, lists, dictionaries
    - Control Flow: if statements, while loop, for loop.

## [Week 2:](https://github.com/hsrwrobotics/Robotics_club_lectures/tree/master/Week%202)
- Here we move on to more practical features of programming that make developing code more practical.
- Github ia very useful platform for sharing and collaborating on just about anything, that we highly recommend learning. It houses various projects, libraries and modules as open source.
- The huge number of libraries available for python is what makes it so popular and easy to use to develop complex code.
- **Agenda**:
    - [Functions][1]: code re-usability in Python.
    - Jupyter notebook: Python IDE that contains live code, equations, visualization and narrative test. You can see an example in  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/house-sales-price-using-regression).
    - Github: A hosting website for software development version control. Please refer to Github [homepage](https://github.com/).
    - Library: numpy, matplotlib, time, webrowser

## [Week 3:](https://github.com/hsrwrobotics/Robotics_club_lectures/tree/master/Week%203)
- We move onto more practical and useful faetures in Python
- Object oriented programming is a very useful approach for creating encapsulated packages and especially when creating games
- Try except blocks are the easiest ways of handling errors inbuilt in Python
- **Agenda**:
    - [Monday][2]: Introduction to classes and error handling
    - [Wednesday][3]: Developing your first text game using OOP
