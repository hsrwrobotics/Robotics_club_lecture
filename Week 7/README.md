# Welcome to Deep learning

Hope you enjoyed the last two exercises. That was a brief intro to machine learning. Now that you are comfortable with classifification and regression problem. Now you can buy land while sipping some quality wine. But wait machine learning doesn't stop there. There is so much more to do. Lets dive deeper now pun intended.

You have been familiar with the perceptron algorithm and how it works. If not fear not we will do a brief recap on that.

Todays Agenda involves-

## Perceptron
## Multi Layer Percptron
## Hand coded Multi layer perceptron for XOR
## Intro to Keras
## XOR with keras
